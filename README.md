# Homework 4 - Hard coding
In this fourth homework we have worked on three distinct topics:
1. Build a Hash function and HyperLogLog structure from scratch
2. Build KMeans' clustering algorithm from scratch by applying it to the Amazon foods dataset
3. Algorithmic question to prove the Running Time

The repository we created contains:

1. A Jupyter Notebook "main.ipynb" file containing for each point of the homework the explanation of what has been done and the relative outputs
2. A python file named as "functions.py" containing all the functions explained that we used in our homework
